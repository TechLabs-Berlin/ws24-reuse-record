How to start the app:

- Go to the client directory
- Run "npm install" to install all packages
- Run "npm start"
- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to try it out on your phone

The server and database are hosted and running on render.com and Mongo DB Atlas.

## Project Description

Reuse of building parts is the single most effective way to reduce grey emissions when constructing or remodeling new and existing buildings. Currently the reuse process is a highly individual unindustrialized process that requires a lot of manual labour and is thus financially out of reach for most projects. Particularly recording and surveying the properties of all the different elements and materials in an existing building is a very time consuming and tedious task.


ðŸš€ Reuse Record aims to change that!

Together we are going to develop a web app that simplifies and speeds up the recording process by lot and creates structured data that later on could be used in the reuse and refurbishment process by humans and machines.
This is accomplished by creating an intuitive and dynamic interface that lets you upload a photo and provides inputs for all important properties of the element (UX & WD FE).

Cluster analyses, utilizing methods such as K-Means and HDBSCAN, attempt to group windows based on certain features for a recommendation system. Different scaling methods are explored to understand their influence on the outcome of the analysis. This comprehensive approach ensures robust insights for effective decision-making in the recommendation system development.(DS)

A graph database is storing all the information in a machine readable way and theoretically allows you to retrieve also complex implicit knowledge. (WD BE & DS)
To make the scope feasible the project is focused on the recording and surveying of window elements.
Windows embody a high amount of carbon, are thrown away by the thousands and are in every building for you to test the app with!

The project is kindly supported with expert knowledge and testing by Baukreisel.
Baukreisel is a non profit interdisciplinary collective of 13 architects, engineers, social scientist and lawyers working towards reuse at scale in the building industry. More Info on GitHub
If all goes well Reuse Record :cyclone: or a further developed Version of it could even be used and tested in one of our future living labs for which we are currently applying for funding.
Conclusion Through meticulous data preprocessing, exploration, and advanced clustering techniques, valuable insights and patterns are extracted from the dataset. This provides a solid foundation for further analysis and decision-making processes. This repository invites exploration and discovery in the realm of data analysis.
