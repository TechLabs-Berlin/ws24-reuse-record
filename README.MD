## Project Description

Reuse of building parts is the single most effective way to reduce grey emissions when constructing or remodeling new and existing buildings. Currently the reuse process is a highly individual unindustrialized process that requires a lot of manual labour and is thus financially out of reach for most projects. Particularly recording and surveying the properties of all the different elements and materials in an existing building is a very time consuming and tedious task.

This problem is especially key when realizing how important data is to create scalable reuse and refurbishment processes.
The current solution are either excel sheets or unsatisfying apps that cannot handle the complexity of e.g. window elements and require you to input data over and over again when creating the record on site.

ðŸš€ Reuse Record aims to change that!

Together we are going to develop a web app that simplifies and speeds up the recording process by lot and creates structured data that later on could be used in the reuse and refurbishment process by humans and machines.
This is accomplished by creating an intuitive and dynamic interface that lets you upload a photo and provides inputs for all important properties of the element (UX & WD FE).

Image recognition is determining wether the element fits a type or configuration in the catalogue (DL).
If it fits, the properties are filled in automatically and can be adjusted through the user. Suggesting location and storey from previous inputs and auto completion while typing is speeding up the process even more. (DS)

A graph database is storing all the information in a machine readable way and theoretically allows you to retrieve also complex implicit knowledge. (WD BE & DS)
To make the scope feasible the project is focused on the recording and surveying of window elements.
Windows embody a high amount of carbon, are thrown away by the thousands and are in every building for you to test the app with!

The project is kindly supported with expert knowledge and testing by Baukreisel.
Baukreisel is a non profit interdisciplinary collective of 13 architects, engineers, social scientist and lawyers working towards reuse at scale in the building industry. More Info on GitHub
If all goes well Reuse Record :cyclone: or a further developed Version of it could even be used and tested in one of our future living labs for which we are currently applying for funding.
