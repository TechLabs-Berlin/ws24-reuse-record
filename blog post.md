## <h2>DS</h2>
<h3>Data Cleaning and Exploration:</h3>
The DS repository is dedicated to the preprocessing and exploration of raw data sourced from a CSV file. Initially, the data is scrubbed to ensure its usability, involving techniques such as handling missing values (NaN), imputing -1 values, and eliminating incomplete rows. Following this, various encoding methods including one hot encoding and label encoding are tested to ready the categorical data for analysis.

<h3>Encoding and Analysis:</h3>
Following data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover hidden patterns and distributions within the dataset. Pearson correlation analysis is then performed to elucidate relationships between different variables.

<h3>Correlation and Clustering:</h3>
The application of K-means clustering allows for the grouping of similar data points, with a focus on categorizing window types based on specific features. Additionally, an exploration of different scalers is undertaken to evaluate their impact on analysis results, including methods such as Min-Max scaling and Standard scaling.

<h3>Advancing to HDBSCAN:</h3>
In pursuit of alternative clustering methods, HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is explored. This technique offers the ability to identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes, particularly advantageous in datasets where traditional methods may yield suboptimal results.

<h3>Synthetic Data Generation and API Integration:</h3>
Beyond clustering, the DS repository offers functionalities for synthetic data generation and integration with external APIs. These features expand the avenues for data exploration and analysis, fostering a deeper understanding of the dataset and its potential applications.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
Through meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced clustering techniques, this repository uncovers valuable insights and patterns within the dataset. These findings serve as a robust foundation for subsequent analysis and decision-making processes. With an open invitation to exploration and discovery, the DS repository contributes to the advancement of data analysis endeavors.

# Frontend

I started a new  React js project in our projects Git repository and worked on different branches. I made short commits regularly and pushed them to my branch. Now I’m comfortable using Git for managing project files while working on different features and collaborating with other devs..

## Working with react and tailwind css
At first, I used React and Tailwind CSS for a desktop version of the app. I learned about components, React Router for navigation, and data structures. Now I can convert objects in data structures.

## Working with useState and useEffect
I used useState to manage the current application's states and useEffect to carry out any action on change.I created a visualization for a window configurator using the given data and configurations, like rows and columns count, cells'  and dimensions, etc and added logical functionality.

## Working with React native Expo and Typescript
After receiving feedback from the midterm presentation, I switched to learning React Native with Expo and TypeScript, which were needed for the project as we were focusing on users who will be using the app on their mobile phones.. I used Expo components, useState, useEffect, and useContext to manage child Sate.

## Working with backend API
 I also worked with APIs for data retrieval and included calculations in the frontend.utilizing calculate function, to consistently visualize the window configurator throughout the user journey.
