Interviews were conducted with members of Baukreisel.

<h1>1. Questions:</h1>
<ol>
<li>How does the process of cataloging look now on-site? You enter the building and what happens then? Do you prepare anything before you do it?</li>

<li>What devices do you use for recording?</li>

<li>Does it happen that there are mistakes during recording items with the current method you’re using?</li>

<li>Is it usually a 1-person task, or do you work in a group or a couple of separate people/groups?</li>

<li>What technologies do you use now? What is the most annoying part? What works well?</li>

<li>What information is necessary for the tender?</li>

<li>Do you need to know where in the building the window is located? In which room/part of the building?</li>

<li>What does the process of evaluating energy efficiency look like?</li>
</ol>

<h1>2. Notes:</h1>

<h2>
Process of cataloging on-site:</h2>
<ol>
<li>figure out the information you need</li>
<li>start somewhere eg. the lowest level. Have a system of that - maybe start on one side of the building and go around</li>
<li>go through the rooms and map windows one by one</li>
<li>current technology: write down data on paper or in the app, place a Zollstock in the picture with the window, read rough measurements from the picture with the scale
check the condition of windows in the pictures/on-site</li>
</ol>

<h3>Issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>checking random elements of windows and then having problems connecting them together, where is it located or what features are connected to a specific element
having software for cataloging that’s very general. It doesn't suit well the purpose of doing that with windows</li>
<li>if you don’t know in the beginning what information you need - in that case, you take too many or too few measurements (and have to go back to the construction site)</li>
<li>putting stickers with QR codes on elements - how to connect it to the window ID? One Sticker on each window sash?</li>
</ul>

<h2>rocess of evaluation (first estimation):</h2>
<ol>
<li>get glass/frame area</li>
<li>information about the time the window was built - a guess. Alternatively: information is written in the window</li>
<li>calculation of CO2 emissions with different options: exchanging windows, improving existing windows, doubling windows…</li>
</ol>
what info is needed? - you have to know that before starting the process:

<ul>
<li>taking a photo, measurements, glazing, and frame material. The system has to be clear from the beginning - which properties</li>
<li>sometimes you need the location of the window in the building (story, east, west, etc.)</li>
<li>ideally, all dimensions of frames to build a window in CAD software but it takes a lot of time - for the initial stage we don't need that information</li>
<li>different properties are needed for tendering and the upgrading stage of the process</li>

Two options for dealing with a building:
<ol>
<li>upgrading, not demolishing. Take windows out and improve them</li>
<li>building demolished, elements are stored, and potentially reused (after being upgraded) (less favored option) - different requirements regarding cataloging</li>
</ol>
</ul>

Convincing a client that upgrading is a good thing to do:

<ul>
<li>show it’s economically viable</li>
<li>show it’s ecologically viable</li>
</ul>

We need for that: which glazing the window has, the frame material, the area of windows, the circumference of glazed panes, the number of windows you have

We don’t necessarily need to know where the window is located in the building (if you’re taking care not to calatogue one window twice). For tendering, it is not important. In the process later it would be useful when windows are being upgraded.

If the client decides to do it - we need more precise data - exact measurements of glass panes (high precision)
