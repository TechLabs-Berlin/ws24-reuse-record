Reuse Record aims to revolutionize data recording in reuse and refurbishment processes. By simplifying data input and utilizing advanced clustering techniques, the web app streamlines the process and provides structured data. With support from Baukreisel, an interdisciplinary collective, the project targets window elements as a starting point, addressing their significant carbon footprint and potential for reuse.
